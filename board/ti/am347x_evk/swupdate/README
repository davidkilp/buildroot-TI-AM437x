Public/Private Keys used to sign a swupdate package:

* Create the private key

$ openssl genrsa -out swupdate-priv.pem


* Create the public key

$ openssl rsa -in swupdate-priv.pem -out swupdate-public.pem -outform PEM -pubout


generate_swu.sh -- shell script used to create the software update file.


===== Required target files: 

 * /etc/swupdate-public.pem
 * /etc/swupdate.cfg

The public key,swupdate-public.pem, must be installed on the original
firmware image 


===== Updating U-boot:

The /etc/swupdate.cfg file should have a "versions" information block that will
be used by the "install-if-different" tag to decide if u-boot should be
updated or not. This is NOT normally updated so to prevent bricking the
device we should not normally update u-boot.

The "versions" block in the /etc/swupdate.cfg will look like this:
versions : (
	{
		name = "bootloader";
		version = "Pocket-1.00";
	}
);


The generated sw-description file, which is created using the "generate_swu.sh" 
script to create the .swu output file. It should have a block that looks
like this for updating u-boot: 

			/* Optional U-boot update */
			images: (
				{
					filename = "u-boot.img";
					device = "mtd5";
					name = "bootloader";
					version = "Pocket-1.00";
					install-if-different = true;
					sha256 = "f9d053f040346e47dec042d07cf77affb101a218ce6edbabb239a935977322d4";
				}


where the version information here will be compared against that from
the /etc/swupdate.cfg versions block. If they are different, then the u-boot
image will be updated. If they match then the u-boot update will be skipped.

If you need to update u-boot then you need to edit the files: 

	- <buildroot>/buildroot/board/ti/am347x_evk/swupdate/generate_swu.sh 
	- <buildroot>/buildroot/board/ti/am347x_evk/rootfs_overlay/etc/swupdate.cfg
	
and edit the bootloader version information so that they match. 
If they values do NOT match then u-boot will be updated to that in the .swu file.
