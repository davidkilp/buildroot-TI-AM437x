Buildroot for TI AM437X Evaluation Board platforms:
 
There are 2 configurations for this board.

 - am437x_evm_defconfig  			- Builds a USBIFS root filesystem for booting from NAND flash.
 - am437x_evm_recovery_defconfig 	- Builds a small combined kernel + RAMFS based root filsystem suitable for update/recovery
 
To build it:

# cd <top of buildroot>
# make am437x_evm_defconfig
# make

NOTE:
The "recovery" image uses a different rootfs overlay scheme that adds
support to run the USB MTP responder (umtpd) program.
