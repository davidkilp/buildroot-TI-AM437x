Buildroot for TI AM437X Evaluation Board platforms:
 
There are 2 configurations for this board.

 - am437x_evm_defconfig  			- Builds a USBIFS root filesystem for booting from NAND flash.
 - am437x_evm_recovery_defconfig 	- Builds a small combined kernel + RAMFS based root filsystem suitable for update/recovery

NOTE:
The "recovery" image uses a different rootfs overlay scheme that adds
support to run the USB MTP responder (umtpd) program.

 
To build normal image:
========================

# cd <top of buildroot>
# make am437x_evm_defconfig
# make


To build Recovery image:
========================

# cd <top of buildroot>
# make am437x_evm_recovery_defconfig
# make

The output is a combined kernel+RAMFS contained in the output/images/zImage file.

To install the recovery image:

To install this to NAND on a running image:
First, erase the NAND.recovery partition:
# flash_erase /dev/mtd12 0 0

Write zImage to this location:
# nandwrite -p /dev/mtd12 zImage 

To install from u-boot using built-in Ethernet and tftp to xfer image:

configure IP address and TFTP server address:
=> setenv ipaddr 192.168.1.30
=> setenv serverip 192.168.1.157
=> tftpboot 0x82000000 zImage

erase the NAND.recovery partition
=> nand erase.part NAND.recovery

write it:
=> nand write 0x82000000 NAND.recovery

to run it manually from u-boot:
=> run findfdt
=> run ramargs
=> nand read ${fdtaddr} NAND.u-boot-spl-os
=> nand read ${loadaddr} NAND.recovery
=> setenv bootargs console=ttyO0,115200n8 consoleblank=0 ignore_loglevel
=> bootz ${loadaddr} - ${fdtaddr}

This will boot from RAM and run the recovery image. A MTP Responder will
be running on the USB port and a USB Host can send/receive files over USB
interface.
